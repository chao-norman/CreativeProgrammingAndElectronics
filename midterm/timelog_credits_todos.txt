 Timelog:
 - [7/15/20] For now I'm only implementing the player throwing balls and bunnies just running around. I'll
 work on the bunnies throwing the balls in the future when I have more time (and mental capacity).
 - [7/19/20] Updated menu GUI, added pause functionality, added additional enemy that shoots projectiles,
added health bars, added sound bytes to in-game interactions, added background music, added menu music, added
retry feature when you lose the game, added high score counter, updated enemy spawning algorithm, 
ORGANIZED METHODS INTO INDIVIDUAL .pde FILES!!
