# Here is the portrait I made on Processing!

My portrait is of me and my partner's first home together. I moved out of my apartment in Berkeley around the end of May (due to COVID-19, online courses, and because I'm graduating in the Fall) and my partner got a job offer earlier this year. Because of these two events, we decided to take the leap and move in together. It took A LOT of time and effort, but we were able to convince our more traditionally minded parents that we would be fine living together. We just moved in together recently (roughly 6 weeks ago) and are extremely excited to start this new chapter of our lives!

The person on the right is me (Norman) and the person on the left is my partner (Lily). I chose to draw us sitting on our couch in the living room with the window blinds open and our snake plant enjoying the sunlight.
